## JSX

> https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx

```
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML. It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. JSX produces React â€œelements

> JSX returns plain JAVASCRIPT objects

## React Components

A function or class that returns a JAVASCRIPT object containing JSX code. This represents your HTML elements grouped under a div tag. We use components for modularity, reusability.
