# Requirements

- Download  the support zip for animal-card
- Next, open card.html and replace the placeholder image and information with your favorite animal's image and information. For the image, you will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Also, don't forget to change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. So, alt="name-of-your-animal" should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.
- The svg and the animal card  should be centered in the page
- By making use of concepts presented today (OOCSS/SASS/LESS) add the following styles to the card:
  - italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
  - bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
  - no dots for the animal's list items
  - border around the animal's name, image, and information
  - border around the animal's information
  - spacing between the animal's name, image, and information
  - Box-shadow around the card
  - Hovering over the animals' list items should highlight the line ( “#F5F5F5”)



## !Bonus: add animation to the existing svg in the project support
