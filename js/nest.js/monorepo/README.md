# NestJS monorepo playground
The purpose of this monorepo is to play around with various concepts. Each new concept will be structured as a new library and the demo will be held as a demo applicaiton or a separate one.

## Usefull commands used in generating the monorepo

```bash
# generate the new project
nest new NAME 

# generate an application in the monorepo
nest generate app X

# generate a library in the monorepo
nest generate library Y
```

! For consistency please use in this project the prefix **@shared** when creating a new librarie
